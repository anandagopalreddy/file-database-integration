# file-database-integration
This project is a Java-based application that integrates file handling with relational database operations, enabling seamless import of structured data (such as CSV or JSON) into a SQL database and export of database records back to files. It uses core Java libraries (java.io, java.nio, java.sql) along with JDBC for database connectivity, supporting popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. The system allows reading files line by line, parsing records, validating input, and inserting data into corresponding database tables. It also supports querying the database and writing the results back to files in the desired format, making it ideal for tasks like data migration, automated backups, data synchronization, and report generation. The architecture is modular and extendable, suitable for real-world use cases such as inventory management, customer data import/export, and log processing systems, and can be easily integrated into desktop or enterprise applications.
